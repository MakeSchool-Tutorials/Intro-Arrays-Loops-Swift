## Common issues
- If you have an array named “imAnArray” remember that “imAnArray” does not access a certain value of an array, rather that certain value has to be accessed by using “imAnArray[x]” where x is the index where the value you are looking for is located.
- Remember that while programming you will not always know how big the array you are working with will be so when looping through values of an array try to avoid using numbers like “5” or “8”. Instead use variables or properties of arrays such as “imAnArray.count”.
- Know that when you are checking if a cell is alive remember to check if it not only below the maximum number column and row but also above 0,0 as well.
- For the countNeighbors function remember that you do not what the variables x and y will contain so check the coordinate’s neighbors relative to these unknown values by using math such as x-1,y, x,y+1, and so on.

## What you should understand when finished
By the time you have finished with this playground you should have gained the understanding of what an array is and how you can implement it within your programming. You should also be able to manipulate arrays through different ways such as appending data to the end of one or using a for loops to iterate through each index within an array. In addition, you should also understand how to use two dimensional arrays along with optional values. Lastly, you should have gained an understanding of how Conway’s game of life works and be able to implement a basic form of it in preparation of Grid Simulations.
